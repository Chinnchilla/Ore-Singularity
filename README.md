# Ore-Singularity
Attempt to make mutiple gen of the same ores easier.

Such as IC2, Forestry, TiCon, and Thermal Foundations multiple instances of Copper and Tin.
Its an easy fix being able to turn off all gen except TF's ores.
BUT if you craft a copper block and then uncraft it, it doesnt always turn back into TF's ingots

The goal of this mod is to get rid of all extra instances of ores even as far as the block and ingot form.

One thing that really bothered me is trying to keep it simple in my AE system but at the same time take advantage of the speeds of certain mods machines. Only to have to run a ingot through a Unifier or something of the sorta to get every ingot to stack inside AE.
